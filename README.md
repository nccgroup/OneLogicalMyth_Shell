# OneLogicalMyth_Shell

This HTA shell was created to assist in breakout assessments. I built this over a year ago initally and thought others might find it useful so have now made it public. Please feel free to submit pull requests.

# Features

The whenChanged attribute is the computer objects modification date not the password, however, its a good indication if the password is stale or not.
